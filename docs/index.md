# Data Open Source


I have been working on the Data domain from last 12+ years and have been sharing my experience, challenegs and learning with the community on different platforms. Before joining the development world I was teaching in a collge to uni students. I started investing in sharing and writing last year from Medium and i feel this year it is high time to start sharing  on a dedicated platform that I own.
